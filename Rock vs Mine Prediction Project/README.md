# 🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project predicts whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine** using the **Sonar dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.  
The model is trained in **Google Colab** using **Logistic Regression** ML algorithm after performing data preprocessing and feature analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify underwater sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine**, helping in applications like submarine detection and underwater object identification.

---

## 🧠 Dataset
- **Name:** Sonar Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains sonar signals bounced off **metal cylinders (mines)** and **rocks** on the sea floor.  
  Each sample includes 60 numerical features representing signal strength at different frequencies.
