# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has **diabetes** or not using **machine learning techniques**.  
The model is trained on the **Diabetes dataset** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm in **Google Colab**.  

## 🧠 Objective
To build an accurate classification model that can help detect diabetes based on key medical features such as:
- Glucose level  
- Blood pressure  
- BMI  
- Age  
- Insulin level, etc.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Google Colab  

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Import and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and normalize data  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train model using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics  

## 📊 Results
The trained model achieved **high accuracy** in predicting diabetes based on patient data.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset (if required)  
3. Run all cells to train and test the model  

## 🧾 Dataset
The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
